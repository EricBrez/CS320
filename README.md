Software testing and automation

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
 - The short and obvious answer is through testing. Through manual testing, manual review, and automated unit, function, and security testing (as well as many other methods) you can test each method, each interaction, each data validation check to ensure that they all function expectantly and interact appropraitely.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
 - After the purpose of the program is determined, we can then decide what the users will need based on the client's requirements. User needs such as usablitiy, ease of understanding, simplicity, and what is needed in the user interface to achieve all of the others can be incorporated into the overall program by considering all of them while designing. It can be easy to design "robotically" focusing solely on the functions of the program and considering the math and logic of what it is supposed to do but it is important to consider the human aspect. The purpose of the program is to be used by humans, and the human part cannot be forgotten in the design.

### How do I approach designing software?
 - My approach to designing software is to make it as simple as possible while still achieving all of the functionality. It is extremely easy for software to become very complex and unideally complicated. I design with simplicity in mind so that even when software inevitably gets complex, it does not become so complicated that it is impossible to read and make edits to later
